## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Create Webhook in Mattermost

1. Go to your Mattermost channel (e.g., `#server-notifications`)
2. Click the **‚ãØ menu > Integrations > Incoming Webhooks**
3. Click **Add Incoming Webhook**
4. Name it something like `PBS Alerts`, assign it a **bot user**, and save
5. Copy the **Webhook URL** (you‚Äôll use this later)

üîí Tip: Create one bot per category (e.g. `kumabot` for UptimeKuma, `proxmoxbot` for VE) to separate sources cleanly. You can also create dedicated users and severely limit there functionality to a single channel as Bots can be set to have full access. 

### Step 2: PBS Integration

In the GUI, head down to `Configuration` and `Notifications`. Click the `Add` drop down and select `Webhook`. Pick a name for the Notification, enable and ensure the `Method:` is set to `POST`. Add your webhook you created in Mattermopst for PBS here. 
Under `Headers:` add a new header. The key should be `Content-Type` and set the value to `application/json`

Add the below template to the `Body:` section:

```bash
{
  "text": ":floppy_disk: **PBS Alert** from {{ host }}
\n ### Title: {{ title }}
\nSeverity: **{{ severity }}**
\nTime: {{ timestamp }}
\nJob Type: {{ fields.type }}
\nJob: {{ fields.job-id }}
\n{{ message }}"
}
```

1. In the GUI, head down to `Configuration` and `Notifications`. Click the `Add` drop down and select `Webhook`. Pick a name for the Notification, enable and ensure the `Method:` is set to `POST`. Add your webhook you created in Mattermopst for PBS here. 
Under `Headers:` add a new header. The key should be `Content-Type` and set the value to `application/json`

2. Paste this JSON in the Mattermost Webhook Body:

```json
{
  "text": ":floppy_disk: **PBS Alert from PBS**\nTitle: {{ title }}\nSeverity: **{{ severity }}**\nTime: {{ timestamp }}\nJob Type: {{ fields.type }}\nDatastore: {{ fields.store }}\nTape Pool: {{ fields.tape-pool }}\nTape Drive: {{ fields.tape-drive }}\n\n{{ message }}"
}
```
